# Auto MPG Analysis Project

This project analyzes the **Auto MPG dataset** using Python and Jupyter
Notebook.\
It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and a
linear regression model to predict MPG.

##  Contents

-   `auto_mpg_analysis_with_markdown.ipynb` --- Full notebook with
    explanations and code\
-   `auto_mpg_analysis.ipynb` --- Base notebook version without
    markdown\
-   `README.md` --- Project overview and instructions

##  Features Included

-   Missing value handling\
-   Normalization of horsepower\
-   Scatterplots and correlation heatmap\
-   Linear regression with train/test split\
-   Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)

## ▶ How to Run

1.  Install required packages:

    ``` bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

2.  Open the notebook:

    ``` bash
    jupyter notebook auto_mpg_analysis_with_markdown.ipynb
    ```

##  Dataset

The dataset comes from the UCI ML Repository and contains:\
- **mpg** --- miles per gallon\
- **horsepower**\
- **weight**\
- **acceleration**\
- **model year**, **origin**, etc.

##  Summary

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using
Python.\
It helps build skills in **data cleaning**, **EDA**, and **machine
learning modeling**.

Feel free to modify or extend the analysis!
